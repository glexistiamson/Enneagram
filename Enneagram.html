    <p>Discover your personality type.</p>
    <img src="withnumbers.png" alt="enneagram" class="w3-image" width="992" height="1108">
    <div class="intro">
      <p> Individuals, professionals, and spiritual searchers all around the globe have embraced the Enneagram as a powerful method for self-discovery and personal improvement. It provides profound insights into human psychology and behavior, allowing us to better understand ourselves and others. In this introduction, we'll look at the Enneagram's history, purpose, and relevance, as well as why learning your Enneagram type may be a life-changing experience.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="intro">
      <p> The Enneagram has its origins in ancient wisdom traditions, but its present form arose in the twentieth century as a result of the work of numerous researchers, notably Oscar Ichazo and Claudio Naranjo. This dynamic system outlines nine different personality types, each with its own set of underlying motives, anxieties, wants, and thinking, feeling, and acting patterns. It goes beyond labels and invites us to investigate the fundamental mechanisms that affect our lives.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="intro">
      <p> The Enneagram's main goal is not to pigeonhole or label people, but rather to promote self-awareness and personal progress. We acquire significant insights into our unconscious habits and habitual responses by knowing our Enneagram type. It sheds light on both our strengths and opportunities for possible improvement by illuminating the basic fears and wants that drive our behaviors. We may go on a revolutionary path of self-discovery, self-acceptance, and self-transcendence as a result of this insight.</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Remaining content -->
    <div class="intro">
      <p> Discovering your Enneagram type is an invitation to begin on a journey of personal development and comprehension. It offers a road map for self-reflection as well as practical methods for navigating relationships, controlling stress, and realizing our full potential. We build empathy, compassion, and successful communication by learning more about our own motivations and the motives of others. The Enneagram is a powerful personal development tool that promotes increased self-awareness, emotional intelligence, and meaningful relationships with those around us.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="intro">
      <p> So, study the Enneagram and begin on a profound path of self-discovery. Discover the patterns that create your life, appreciate your talents, and work compassionately with your areas for development. Understanding your Enneagram type may help you live a more real, satisfying, and harmonious existence.</p>

        <p>Ones are conscientious and ethical, with a strong sense of right and wrong.

        <h3>Type 4 - Individuals</h3>
        <p>Fours are self-aware, sensitive, and reserved. They are emotionally honest, creative, and personal, but can also be moody and self-conscious.

        <h3>Type 6 - Loyalist</h3>
        <p>The committed, security-oriented type. Sixes are reliable, hard-working, responsible, and trustworthy. Excellent "troubleshooters," they foresee problems and foster cooperation, but can also become defensive, evasive, and anxious—running on stress while complaining about it.

        <p>Eights are self-confident, strong, and assertive. Protective, resourceful, straight-talking, and decisive, but can also be ego-centric and domineering. Eights feel they must control their environment, especially people, sometimes becoming confrontational and intimidating. Eights typically have problems with their tempers and with allowing themselves to be vulnerable. <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-8/"target="_blank">Read more</a></p>

      <div class="w3-half">
        <h3>Type 9 - Peacemaker</h3>
        <p>Nines are accepting, trusting, and stable. They are usually creative, optimistic, and supportive, but can also be too willing to go along with others to keep the peace. They want everything to go smoothly and be without conflict, but they can also tend to be complacent, simplifying problems and minimizing anything upsetting. They typically have problems with inertia and stubbornness. <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-9/"target="_blank">Read more</a></p>
